Description: Compress tool for Next Generation Sequencing data
 Leon is a software to compress Next Generation Sequencing data.
 It can compress Fasta or Fastq format. The method does not require
 any reference genome, instead a reference is built de novo from the set
 of reads as a probabilist de Bruijn Graph. It uses the disk streaming k-mer
 counting algorithm contained in the GATB library, and inserts solid k-mers
 in a bloom-filter. Each read is then encoded as a path in this graph, storing
 only an anchoring kmer and a list of bifurcations indicating which path to
 follow in the graph if several are possible.
