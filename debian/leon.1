.SH NAME
leon \- a fasta and fastq read compressor using a probabilistic de Bruijn Graph.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Leon is a fasta and fastq read compressor using a probabilistic de Bruijn Graph, without the need of any reference genome.
It compresses qualities in lossy mode by default, by using information from k-mer counting. Downstream analysis on SNP
calling compared to a gold standard showed the modification in qualities can in fact increase SNP calling performance (a little).

.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory options
.TP
.BI "\-file"
input file (e.g. FASTA/FASTQ for compression or .leon file for decompression).
.TP
.BI "\-c"
compress.
.TP
.BI "\-d"
decompress.
.PP

Optional parameters
.TP
.BI "\-nb\-cores"
number of cores (default is the maximum available number of cores).
.PP

Optional Compression parameters

.TP
.BI "\-kmer-size   <int> "
kmer size  (default 31), currently should be <32 (or need to recompile, see below)
.TP
.BI "\-abundance   <int>"
minimal abundance threshold for solid kmers  (default: automatic)
.TP
.BI "\-lossless"
switch to lossless compression for qualities (default is lossy. lossy has much higher compression rate, and the loss is in fact a gain. lossy is better!)
.TP
.BI "\-seq\-only"
store dna sequence only, header and qualitiess are discarded, will decompress to fasta (same as \-noheader \-noqual)
.TP
.BI "\-noheader"
discard header
.TP
.BI "\-noqual"
discard quality scores
.PP

.SH EXAMPLES

Generates the file read.leon
.PP
.RS
leon \-file read.fasta \-c
.RE
.PP
Generates the file read_d.fasta
.PP
.RS
leon \-file read.leon  \-d
.RE
.PP

Note :
In order to use k values larger than 31, recompilation is necessary
(for the moment, this will be improved in next versions).
In the sequence of commands given in the INSTALL file, change the command:
.PP
.RS
cmake ..
.RE
.PP
by:
.PP
.RS
cmake \-Dk1=64 \-Dk2=96 \-Dk3=128 \-Dk4=162 ..
.RE
.PP
this will allow to use k<63
for larger k, change the values such that they are multiple of 32 and k1<k2<k3<k4
